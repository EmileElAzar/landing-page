# landing-page
Hello again!
Took quite a long break but here we go once again. Now, i am designing a landing page from a given design, where HTML, CSS (Flexbox) will be implemented. 

Obviously it is easier to create a design with an end product already known but this is a precursor to a personal project where I will be designing my own website (already nervous). 

I will revisit this in a couple of months to attept to refine the code in terms of short/long-hand proeprties and making it more flexible. 

Unfortunately I couldn't crack some aspects of the planned design but I'll come back to it in a bit :)
